        <h2>Description</h2>
	<p>ASTR 599 is a Graduate seminar course offered through the UW
	  Astronomy department in the Fall of 2013.  It is designed as
	  a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing in Python,
	  geared toward graduate students, postdocs, and researchers in
	  Astronomy and Astrophysics.
	  Much of the curriculum will be modeled after the

    <h2>Long Description</h2>
    <p>This graduate seminar course will offer a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing in Python, geared toward students and researchers in Astronomy. The course is aimed at those who already have some familiarity with computational tools and programming languages &mdash; i.e. who know what a terminal is and how to use it, and are familiar with basic programming concepts such as for loops and if-else statements &mdash; though it will assume no familiarity with the Python programming language.</p>

    <p>The two-day boot camp in the days before the start of the quarter will begin with a broad introduction to the basic syntax of Python: data types and operations, loops and conditionals, manipulation and visualization of data, and basic object-oriented programming. From that base, we will move on to a broad overview of the main computing tools of scientific computing in Python: IPython for an interactive computing environment, NumPy for handling of array-based data, Matplotlib for visualization of this data, and Scipy for common tasks such as integration, interpolation, optimization, and linear algebra. In addition to this, we will introduce the use of Git, a distributed version control system, which we will be using throughout the quarter to keep track of code and assignments.</p>

    <p>The hour-long seminar slots each week during the quarter will build upon the knowledge-base covered in the boot camp, and introduce more advanced Python tools such as Scikit-learn for machine learning and data mining, Scikit-image for pixel-level data processing, SymPy for symbolic mathematics, IPython for parallel processing, Cython for writing fast algorithms, and much more. Each week will include a short 1-2 hour take-home assignment aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered during class. The assignments will focus on tasks that will be useful in the day-to-day work of astronomical research.</p>

    <p>While the course is designed for graduate students who are in their first year or two of research, it is also open to any faculty, researchers or others who would like to brush-up on their Python skills. Upper-level undergraduates and students from other departments will also be considered on a case-by-case basis. For more information, please email me at jakevdp@cs.washington.edu.</p>
